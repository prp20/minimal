# Work Experience(Projects)

## 3D Camera Calibration and Python Application Development using AI Models

-   Worked on development of Real Time 3D Camera Calibration strategy using Python, Pytorch,
    Open3D and Docker. Reduced the time of inference by 80%.
-   Developed a Docker Compose enabled solution with usage of AI technologies such as Feature
    Matching and Localization.
-   Converted and Modified existing AI models to suit the needs of application. This increased the
    speed of training and inference by about 30%.
-   Integrated the solution on using MQTT, Video Feed on a system designed for iOT enabled
    devices.

## 3D Rendering and Visualization using Realsense Cameras.

-   Developed Real Time Visualization application on Python using the feed of Intel Realsense
    Sensor and Open3d Library..
-   Created an inference pipeline for real time segmentation and labeling of obtained point clouds
    using Pytorch based Deep Learning Model and Open3d.
-   Decreased the inference time by 50% without usage of any accelerators.

## Real TIme Microservices Based Solution Delivery System using MERN Stack

-   Architected, led and developed a Solution Delivery System from scratch using MERN stack
    which has 1000+ downloads in the public domain.
-   Developed the initial POC, then a complete solution. Initially it was a monolithic architecture, but
    later it was converted to a microservice based Architecture. This reduced the access time by
    more than 30%.
-   Led the development of a management portal for the aforementioned solution, which decreased
    the maintenance time by 80%.
-   The backend portal was integrated with tools such as Jenkins, Checkmarx and Bandit for the
    CICD operations.
